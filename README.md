# Diffusion differential resampling

This repository features implementation for the paper "diffusion differential resampling".
In this paper, we have introduced a new differentiable-by-construction and consistent resampling method via diffusion models. 

# Installation
Install via a standard procedure. 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zgbkdlm/diffres.git
cd diffres

python -m venv .venv
python .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

# Example
Run any script in `./demos`.

# Reproduce experiments
The results in the paper are generated by the bash scripts in the folder `./experiments`. 
At your local machine, you would need to slightly adjust the scripts.
